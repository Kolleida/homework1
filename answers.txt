What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge takes the changes made from the latest commit on the other branch and incorporates them into the main branch
(or whatever branch you're merging into) in a new commit on the main branch. A rebase takes the entire commit history
of the other branch and appends it to the end of the main branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your project that is stored on the web, specifically at the Github website. This
allows multiple developers to work on the same project and see the changes made by others. Each developer can have a local
repository where the make changes and then push their changes to the central remote repository for feedback, etc.
