What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your project that is stored on the web, specifically at the Github website. This
allows multiple developers to work on the same project and see the changes made by others. Each developer can have a local
repository where the make changes and then push their changes to the central remote repository for feedback, etc.
